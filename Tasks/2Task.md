# Programming Language


## The C++ Programming Language

[C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/) is a popular, general-purpose programming language.
It is often considered an intermediate-level language because it admits both high-level and low-level paradigms.
C++ adds object-oriented programming features to C.
It supports classes and their main attributes: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Technically, C++ incorporates the C standard library, with slight modifications.
Pertinent documentation about this language can be found on the C++ resources network.

Many compilers are available for C++, including Visual Studio (Microsoft) and GCC (GNU Project).
The C/C++ syntax forms the basis for software development on several microcontroller platforms.
Texas A&amp;M University provides access to several books on C++ programming.
For example, The C++ programming language is accessible online through campus.

To build and debug a C++ projects, a toolchain is required.
Each platform that runs a C/C++ Development Tools (CDT) requires a unique installation process.
