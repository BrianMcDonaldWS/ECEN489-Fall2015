## SQLite

[SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/) is an in-process library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine.
It is ACID-compliant and implements most of the SQL standard.
SQLite is a popular choice as embedded database for local/client storage in application software, and it has bindings to many programming languages.
Pertinent information about SQLite can be found on the project website.
